Brave Alex Studio is a project by me, Danielle M., a software engineer and writer. I've loved RPGs since I was a kid and have been starting to make stuff in the TTRPG space. This is a place to collect my thoughts and share my projects.

I am committed to donating proceeds from my projects to rabbit rescues and charities. This is my way of honoring the memory of my Alex, for whom this endeavor is named.

## Why 'Brave Alex'?

I've written about this in the [first post of the blog](../notes/why-brave-alex). The short version is that I was guardian to a rabbit named Alex from 2011-2018 and he faced many medical challenges, but, against type (rabbits are prey animals and have a lot of innate fear), he was brave in the face of all of it. He had a special way of being curious about the world and wanting to experience it, which are both things I wish to cultivate in my own life/work. He was the bestest boy - my Samwise Gamgee - and I miss him dearly.
